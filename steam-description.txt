[h1]Birch World Start For Gigastructures[/h1]

This gives you an origin that lets you start on a Birch World in the Galactic Core and appreciate the amazing Birch World graphics.  Elowiny swears that the symbols on it are actually planet sized habitats, I prefer to believe they are arcane runes because Birch World is Space Magic!

It is an addition to, and requires [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=1121692237]Gigastructural Engineering[/url]

The birch world and surrounding systems will spawn on game start, and in the midgame the galactic core will automatically connect to the rest of the galaxy.

You may find it's not actually as cushy a start as first appears.  Birch worlds are designed for much higher populations.  You need 200 just to build 1 of each district.  Be prepared to do some job management on starting: Dark Matter is less useful to you than food and consumer goods.

There is an option on starting that will seed the galactic core with a number of active and ruined megastructures from [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=1121692237]Gigastructural Engineering[/url], if you select this option and have [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=865040033]Guilli's Planet Modifiers[/url] installed, it will also seed some appropreate modifiers.

The game will hang on first start as it spawns the systems, this hanging is proportional to galaxy size.
